# Pure libraries

## Main repository
You can find the main repository of Pure [here][Pure].

## Why

These libraries are in this different repo so that I can ``git push -f`` as needed, to prevent bloating
the main repository / Github with unneeded binaries history.

These repository contains libraries as a local Maven repository as well as the sources for some of them.
